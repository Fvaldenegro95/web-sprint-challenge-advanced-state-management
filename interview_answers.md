# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
It enables you to exchange unique details and helps with prop-drilling from all levels.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
An action is an event that describes something that happened in the application
Reducers are functions that take the current state and action as arguments, and it returns a new state result
Store handles as a state container that holds the application's state.


3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.


4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
Redux! It just flows easily and is very clean to write.
